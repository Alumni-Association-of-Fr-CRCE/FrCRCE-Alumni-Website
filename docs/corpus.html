        'The happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more.
        Your greatest gift is the ability to share your blessings; it's what
        makes life meaningful.'

        profound pride. You know you are a part of something much bigger than
        yourself. What better place to honour the place you used to call home
        than to give something back? The collective impact of your contributions
        be it your time, talent and treasure can make a critical difference to
        your Alma mater. Your contribution and involvement are vital to
        improving the student experience, creating new ideas and path breaking
        research, and enabling the ever-improving academic stature of Fr. CRCE.

      <p>Your generous gifts will enable us to provide support to</p>
      <h3>Alumni Association</h3>
      <p>
        The Alumni Association constantly strives to bridge the gap between the
        Institute and the Alumni by organising Alumni Meets and various other
        Alumni Interaction programs, events and meetings. Your contributions
        will be a great help to us.
      </p>

      <h3>Monetary Scholarships for students</h3>
      <div class="content scholarship">

          <p>
            A large number of deserving students are still left without the
            financial support that they deserve. When a student lacks direction
            or funding, it can make them feel small in the large world of
            education. By giving students the resources they need, you're giving
            them more control of their situation, their goals, and their entire
            future. Each donation you make removes financial barriers for our
            students who turn their higher education into a lifetime of
            opportunity.

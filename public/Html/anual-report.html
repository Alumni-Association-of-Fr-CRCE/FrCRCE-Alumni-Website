            contributing to their alma mater by instituting awards, joint

          <h3>Panel Discussion</h3>
          <p>
            Panel discussions were the best informative sessions arranged by the
            committee for the welfare of the current students. The speakers of

            for further studies” and “Explore their start-up dreams”, and also
            what should be their plan for execution.

            own startup. The panel discussions also helped students to get a
            clear vision about what they want for their bright future. Both the
            panel discussions were held virtually and the committee received an
            astonishing response from the students.

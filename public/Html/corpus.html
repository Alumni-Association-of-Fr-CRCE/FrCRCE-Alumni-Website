          <p>
            The Fr. Agnel Balbhavan is a home to children from all over the
            country belonging to different ethnic groups and religions, races
            and languages. These children are welcomed, cared, sheltered and are
            given a new experience of love and belongingness. Your generous
            giving will be used for the holistic development of these children.
            <br />
            The Scheme offers the Benefactors/Well-wishers an opportunity to
            share in the noble work of bringing up over 600 poor children

      <h3>Scholarships for monetary students</h3>
      <div class="content scholarship">
        <div>
          <p>
            A large number of deserving students are still left without the
            financial support that they deserve. When a student lacks direction
            or funding, it can make them feel small in the large world of
            education. By giving students the resources they need, you're giving
            them more control of their situation, their goals, and their entire
            future. Each donation you make removes financial barriers for our
            students who turn their higher education into a lifetime of
            opportunity.

    <h2>International Chapter Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      The Alumni Association of Fr.CRCE is currently planning on building an
      International Alumni Chapters for connecting the CRCEites spread all over
      the world to their ROOTS. The primary target of these International
      Chapters is to create a channel of contact between the alum and the
      institute, and among the alums themselves.These chapters will be a
      platform for the CRCEites moving abroad, where they can seek guidance and
      help from fellow alums.
    </p>

      <p>
        For the smooth functioning of the International Chapters the Alumni
        Association has formulated a 6 point program:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each chapter would be based on a particular geographical location.
        </li>
        <li>
          The members of these chapters would be the alums living in those
          particular locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The members of a chapter will stay connected via a common group,
          created on any social networking app suitable to the members of the
          chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each chapter will have a Chapter Representative responsible for the
          functioning of his/her Chapter.
        </li>
        <li>Each chapter will be a growing community of CRCE alums.</li>
        <li>These chapters would be self-functional.</li>
        <li>
          Each chapter will stay connected to the institute via the chapter
          representative.
        </li>
      </ul>

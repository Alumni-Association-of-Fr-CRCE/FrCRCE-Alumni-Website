        <p>
          The Alumni Association of Fr.CRCE is currently planning on building an
          International Alumni Chapters for connecting the CRCEites spread all
          over the world to their ROOTS. The primary target of these
          International Chapters is to create a channel of contact between the
          alum and the institute, and among the alums themselves.These chapters
          will be a platform for the CRCEites moving abroad, where they can seek
          guidance and help from fellow alums.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the smooth functioning of the International Chapters the Alumni
          Association has formulated a 6 point program:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each chapter would be based on a particular geographical location.
          </li>
          <li>
            The members of these chapters would be the alums living in those
            particular locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The members of a chapter will stay connected via a common group,
            created on any social networking app suitable to the members of the
            chapter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each chapter will have a Chapter Representative responsible for the
            functioning of his/her Chapter.
          </li>
          <li>Each chapter will be a growing community of CRCE alums.</li>
          <li>These chapters would be self-functional.</li>
          <li>
            Each chapter will stay connected to the institute via the chapter
            representative.
          </li>
        </ul>

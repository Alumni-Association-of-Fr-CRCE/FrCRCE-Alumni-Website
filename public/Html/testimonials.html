              scholarship allows me to focus more on my studies rather than

              continuing so that students like me always feel motivated.

              Since the time I had applied for a scholarship at the Stulz
              Foundation, I was curious if I would get it. As soon as I came to
              know that I have received the scholarship amount, I was elated. On

              providing me Scholarship and helping me financially in my
              academics. I also thank the Alumni Committee of CRCE for bridging
              the gap between students like me and the Stulz foundation.

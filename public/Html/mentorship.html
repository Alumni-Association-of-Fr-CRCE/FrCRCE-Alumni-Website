        <p>
          The Mentorship Program provides the right guidance by conducting
          webinars and helping the students in deciding a successful career path
          according to their aptitude and talents. They are enabled to settle
          down in life on their own with a decent earning and status. Along with
          providing financial aid, the Alumni can also partake in the mentorship
          program and share their expertise on any topic that they would like.
          There could be one on one sessions, webinars, panel discussions etc.
          The Alumni can also sign-up for mentoring the technical teams of our
          Institute and can share their ideas to improvise the existing plans in
          order to design a project that would represent our college in National
          and International competitions.
